### Implementation of the New Item Creation Template

I hope this email finds you well.
We are pleased to introduce the new and improved Item Creation Template, which will replace the previous version. This update brings several key enhancements to improve data accuracy, standardization, and efficiency in item creation.
## Key Improvements:
Additional "Dropdowns" Tab: This feature introduces predefined selections to reduce manual errors and ensure consistency across data entries.
Expanded Number of Fields: The new template now contains 44 columns compared to the previous 26, allowing for more comprehensive item information.
Clearer Field Categorization: Mandatory and optional fields are now explicitly defined, improving clarity and reducing incorrect submissions.
Better Structure for Data Quality: The template enforces stricter validation rules, ensuring that all required data is captured correctly before item creation.
Support for IC-INTERCOMPANY and PRODUCTION Items: The template dynamically adjusts columns based on user needs, making it more adaptable to different item categories.
Conditional Column Appearance Based on Base Company Selection: When users select "RESOLUX BRAZIL" as the base company, additional columns for NCM and description in Portuguese become available, aligning the template more closely with real business logic.
With these improvements we expect a smoother, more reliable process for item management. @Rafael Faria Please ensure that the new template is used in ISOware moving forward.
